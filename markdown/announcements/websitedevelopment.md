webstatus: Active Development

Hello Viewer! If parts of this website feel uncompleted or buggy, that's because I'm currently working on building this website. There may be gaps in development as I attempt to balance this between school projects and assignments, but do not fear, for I will *eventually* finish this. Either that, or I'll scrap this whole thing and restart

On another note, if you want to see what my current progress is, feel free to check out the [Github Repository](https://github.com/LittleTealeaf/littletealeaf.github.io) responsible for this website!
