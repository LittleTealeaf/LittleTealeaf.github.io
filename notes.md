# Developer Notes

## The Console Idea:

For my project section, I can totally have the console slide alongside, and the user would be able to put "goto __" in order to smooth navigate to that section

Alternatively, typing the `\`` key could have the effect of a drop down command prompt?

# Projects:

For larger screens, it displays a "file" like menu. To the right is the preview pane.

If the screen is too small, it will hide the file menu behind the main screen
