# littletealeaf.github.io

My personal portfolio made as a website!

## Proposed Ideas

 - So, the pages of the website will be on the left, like files in vscode.
 - However, each page has the ability to have sub-pages, like in vscode.
 - Pages in the side panel will either be expanded (if either the base page or any sub-pages are open), or collapsed
 - The user should be able to expand the page without opening the page itself.
 - The currently viewed page is always highlighted, regardless of clicks.

> This calls for yet another complete rewrite
## Terminology

 - Drawer: The side panel
 - File: The entry in the side panel referring to each page
 - Page: Everything that is not the drawer
 - Tabs: The list of tabs at the top of the page
 - Header: The section where the tabs are
 - Content: The section where the page is rendered in


## CSS Rules

`--name` -> States
`_name` -> Specific Content Pages
`__name` --> specific content items
`?name
