My personal portfolio made as a website!

## Proposed Ideas

 - So, the pages of the website will be on the left, like files in vscode.
 - However, each page has the ability to have sub-pages, like in vscode.
 - Pages in the side panel will either be expanded (if either the base page or any sub-pages are open), or collapsed
 - The user should be able to expand the page without opening the page itself.
 - The currently viewed page is always highlighted, regardless of clicks.
